  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 24, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>MSNAudioBookRead</strong> is a personal-use Android application designed to play mp3 audiobook files located in the <strong>/Music/BOOKS</strong> directory on your device. This app is not intended for general public use or for children.</p>

  <h2>Information Collection</h2>
  <p><strong>MSNAudioBookRead does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.</strong></p>
  <p>The app accesses the device's <strong>MediaStore</strong> to locate and play audio files. It also interfaces with <strong>Android Auto</strong> to allow audio playback while driving.</p>
  <p>For user convenience, the app stores playback progress locally on your device. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Last played file name</li>
    <li>Folder location within <strong>/Music/BOOKS</strong></li>
    <li>Last playback position (frame or timestamp)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All this data remains on your device and is not shared with anyone or transmitted anywhere.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The app does not use any third-party services, analytics, advertising networks, or external data processors.</p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>The app requests permission to access your device's storage through the <strong>MediaStore</strong> API. This is solely to locate and play mp3 files in the <strong>/Music/BOOKS</strong> directory. It does not access or process any other files or data.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app is not intended for children. It is designed exclusively for the personal use of the developer and is not distributed for use by others.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>All data related to playback progress is stored locally on the device. No information is transmitted off the device or to any external services.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy is unlikely to change since the app is intended solely for personal use. However, if any changes occur, this page will be updated accordingly.</p>
